# godot chess engine
 working on this to keep me busy

got the pieces to be the right size
pieces are taken from an imprecise rect of the spritesheet
got all the pieces to the correct "Squares"

debugging:  all pieces are using the pawn texture

TODO: 
    redefine how the "spaces" are calculated so that they are actually on the boardlol
