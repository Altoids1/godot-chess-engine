 working on this to keep me busy

got the pieces to be the right size

pieces are taken from an imprecise rect of the spritesheet

debugging:  all pieces are using the pawn texture
            all pieces are ontop of eachother
            all pieces are appearing onto the "A1" space
TODO: 
    redefine how the "spaces" are calculated so that they are actually on the boardlol
    
    -> all the sprites are "centered". need to uncenter them and re-math them so atleast the board is centered or something
