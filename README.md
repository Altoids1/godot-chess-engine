# godot chess engine
 working on this to keep me busy

got the pieces to be the right size
got all the pieces to the correct "Squares"
fixed `boardRect` so it updates correctly now
all pieces have correct texutres

pieces now take up entire square
centered the pieces on their respective squares
board sits at an imprecise (although correct) distance from the corner of the window

debugging:  

TODO: 
    
    make pieces draggable
